ClientRpc Program
The ClientRpc program is a Python-based implementation of the foundational capabilities of an RPC (Remote Procedure Call) framework. It is designed with a focus on reusability, extensibility, and modularity, making it a flexible and adaptable solution for various RPC needs.

Prerequisites
Python Installation
To run this program, Python must be installed on your system.

Check Python Installation
Open your command prompt or terminal.

Type the following command and press Enter:
python --version

If Python is installed, this command will display the Python version number (e.g., Python 3.x.x).

If you don't have Python installed, you can download and install it from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

How to Run the Program
The program can be executed by running the included batch script. This script automates the process, making it easy to test the flow of the RPC framework.

Steps to Execute
Navigate to the project directory.
Double-click the "ExecuteProgram.bat" file to run the program.

Note: 
Ensure that the folder name 01_ClientRpc remains unchanged and that the batch file is placed one level outside of this folder.
This will initiate the RPC process and execute the code flow for you.
